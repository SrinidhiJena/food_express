# 🍔 FoodExpress — Premium Food Delivery Marketplace & Dispatch Dashboard

A modern, full-stack food delivery marketplace platform built with **Astro**, **TypeScript**, and **Firebase** (Authentication, Firestore, and Hosting). FoodExpress acts as a middleman hub connecting customers with local partner restaurants, featuring a live order dispatch pipeline and a unified role-based administrative control center.

## 🍃 Spring Boot & Spring Security Backend (Migrated Version)

We have converted the application to a robust **Spring Boot** backend using **Spring Security** (stateless JWT authentication) and an in-memory **H2 database** (auto-seeded on startup). The vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript client is served directly from the embedded Tomcat server on port `8082`.

### 🚀 Quick Start (Spring Boot)

1. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
2. **Access the App**:
   Open **[http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)** in your browser.
3. **Log In (Developer Credentials)**:
   - **Email**: `dev@foodexpress.com`
   - **Password**: `dev@123`
4. **H2 Database Console**:
   Available at **[http://localhost:8082/h2-console](http://localhost:8082/h2-console)** (Driver: `org.h2.Driver`, JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:foodexpress`, Username: `sa`, Password: *blank*).

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏪 1. Partner Restaurant Marketplace (Middleman Architecture)
- Food items are categorized and mapped directly to partner restaurants (e.g., *Paradise Biryani, Shah Ghouse, Mehfil, Chutneys, Irani Cafe*).
- Customer orders track and partition items by their preparation source, acting as a unified middleman aggregator.

### 📖 2. Interactive Floating "Menu Book"
- Triggered directly from the navigation bar.
- Displays a clean, text-based, print-style restaurant menu layout grouped by culinary categories (*Biryanis, Tiffins, Breads, Combos, Beverages, Desserts, Curries*).
- Interactive quantity controllers (`+ Add` and `- Qty +`) let users configure their cart straight from the menu book modal.

### 🔢 3. Page-by-Page Menu Pagination
- The landing page features a paginated food grid limited to **6 items per page** for fast loading and clean layout.
- Integrates smooth, responsive page controllers with automatic scroll-to-top transition.

### 📋 4. Secure Customer Checkout
- Structured delivery capture during checkout collecting:
  - **Full Customer Name**
  - **Phone Number**
  - **Delivery Address**
  - **Payment Mode** (Cash on Delivery)

### 🚚 5. Live Order Dispatch Dashboard (Admin Panel)
- **Role-Based Views:** Administrative panels feature dynamic headings and tailored layout controls depending on the authenticated account's permissions:
  - **Super Admin Dashboard** (for account `srinidhijena@gmail.com`)
  - **Developer Admin Panel**
  - **Menu Editor Panel**
- **Zomato/Swiggy-style Delivery Pipeline:** An interactive progress visualizer tracking delivery status from `Received` ➔ `Kitchen Cooking` ➔ `Out for Delivery` ➔ `Delivered` in real-time.
- **🖨️ Invoice Generator:** Instant print-ready invoice formatting containing order details, restaurant sources, and customer shipping logs.

npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or update the config in `src/scripts/firebaseApp.js`) with your Firebase Project coordinates:
```env
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

## 🛡️ Firestore Security Configuration
Security rules in `firestore.rules` protect the marketplace records:
* **Foods Collection:** Read is public. Write operations (Create, Update, Delete) are authorized only for editors verified against the `/editors` collection.
* **Orders Collection:** Read is public (for order tracking page lookup). Create is allowed for any authenticated user. Write/update is restricted to authorized administrative users.

To deploy security rules:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```
